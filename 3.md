## General Observations

## General Observations

- **Age-Based Segments:** Age-based clusters were apparent in all linkage types. Customers with similar ages tended to group together, with some variations in cluster composition based on the linkage method used.

- **Gender-Based Clusters:** Gender-based clustering were similar in all linkage methods as they had a binary value.

- **Income and Spending Score Clusters:** Income and spending score influenced cluster formation. High-income customers sometimes formed separate clusters, while spending score contributed to distinct groupings based on spending behavior.

- **Comparison Across Linkage Methods:** The choice of linkage method impacted cluster shapes and sizes. Ward linkage, for instance, created clusters with similar sizes, while single linkage produced more uneven cluster sizes.

- **Limited Contribution:** The binary nature of the "gender" feature, encoded as 0 or 1, results in a fixed and limited range of values for distance calculations. In hierarchical clustering, this binary variable may not significantly influence cluster formation when combined with other features such as age, income, and spending score.

- **Impact of Scaling:** Scaling or normalizing continuous variables (e.g., age, income, spending score) is important in hierarchical clustering. Scaling ensures that all variables have a similar impact on distance calculations, which can help prevent one variable from dominating the clustering process. However, the binary nature of "gender" may still have limited impact on distances even after scaling.
